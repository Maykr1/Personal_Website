                    <p>Due to being a part of the Robotics Team at Saint Xavier High School, I frequently visited their innovation lab. In this innovation lab, they had a lot of 3D printers and electronics. In combination with this and this video <a href = "https://youtu.be/5lRApF-siVo?si=K6iTaIWWfiyL023K" target = "_blank">here</a>, I wanted to build the Gray Fox Helmet from Metal Gear Solid. Using 3D Models which can be found <a href = "https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/various/gray-fox-cyborg-ninja-helmet-motorized" target = "_blank">here</a>, I was able to build this helmet.</p>

                    <p>While building this helmet a lot of problems arose. When I made this helmet, a lot of design considerations had to be considered. This included the fact that the 3D Models did not come with parts that made it faithful to the game. An example of this was the central circular light. To fix this issue, I had to outsource and design my own parts to make an Adafruit NeoPixel Ring 12 fit in the center.</p>

                    <p>Another design issue that arose was that, due to the older design of the 3D Model, the top plate would not move with the SG90 motors that I used for this project. They were not strong enough and they were not able to move the helmet without a severe amount of servo jitter. To fix this issue, I had to permanently attach the top plate to the helmet base. However, this was not much of a concern to me as I was very proud with the end result. In fact, this same helmet was featured on the Saint Xavier Youtube and News Channel.</p>
