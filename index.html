                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I am Ethan Clark and I am an aspiring Software Developer who specializes in Python Programming and Embedded Systems Engineering. Everyday I strive to learn something new relating to software engineering! I am currently studying at the University of Louisville for a degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in Artifical Intelligence. I am also currently learning many topics on Codecademy including Artifical Intelligence, Computer Science, Python, Java, C++, HTML & CSS, and much more. In fact, I learned how to make this very website using Codecademy!</p>
