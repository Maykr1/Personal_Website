                    <p>The learning opportunities that I gained with my first two personal projects helped me in the development of this next project. I became inspired by the RedHood helmet made by Kevin from <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@3DPrintedProps">3D Printed Props</a>. After watching his series about making a Red Hood helmet, I knew what my next project would be. I wanted to make a full Red Hood suit. So I started with the helmet which I purchased from Villanous Prop Shop <a href = "https://villainouspropshop.com/product/red-hood-helmet-rebirth-3d-model-stl/">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>I wanted to replicate Kevin's final finish with my own personal touches. I sanded it until the marks left by the supports had disappeared. Then I spray painted it with Rustoleum Filler Sandable Primer. Next, I filled it with glazing spot putty and put on another coat of primer until it was super smooth. After this, I spray painted it with Rustoleum Gold Finish, Duplicolor Metalcast Anondized Red and Duplicolor Matte Finish until it was blood red. The next step was to add on some final details. This included adding blacking out the eyes, installing LED Eye panels, and weathering it. Finally, I made a suit out of it by buying a leather jacket, tactical pants, boots, gloves, a vest with a Red Hood emblem on it, and 3D printed some shin guards and boot guards. </p>
